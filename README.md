# Hey, I'm Rick! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a seasoned software developer and educator with extensive experience in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Over the years, I've had the privilege of teaching these technologies, helping many developers get started and advance their careers.

## About Me

### Professional Expertise

- **Docker**: Specializing in containerization and container orchestration, ensuring applications run consistently across different environments.
- **Software Architecture**: Expertise in designing scalable and maintainable software systems.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Proficient in breaking down complex applications into manageable and independent services.

### Additional Skills
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Proficient in Keycloak and general auth integration to secure applications.
- **JavaScript & TypeScript**: Passionate about modern JavaScript and TypeScript, constantly exploring new features and best practices.
- **React & Preact**: While React is a go-to framework for me, I also enjoy working with Preact for its simplicity and performance.
- **Sass**: A big fan of Sass for its powerful features that make CSS development more efficient and fun.

### Education
- **Art (Illustration and Computer Graphics)**: I have a background in art, which helps me bring a unique perspective to UI/UX design and development.

## My Interests
Beyond coding, I love diving into the world of art, particularly illustration and computer graphics. This blend of technology and creativity allows me to approach problems with a fresh and innovative mindset.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about tech, art, or anything in between!
